# VisualSceneCompiler

This project simulates a basic compiler that interprets a domain-specific language designed to describe visual scenes. I developed it to better understand how high-level instructions could be parsed and rendered into a graphical layout. The system handles nested components, layout types, and error detection. Building this gave me hands-on experience with parsing logic, state management, and JavaFX rendering, making it one of the more conceptually rich projects I've worked on.
